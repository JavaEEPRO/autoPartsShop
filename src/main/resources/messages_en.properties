Tooth length in mm: medium - 22, span -17-27\
The number and names of the roots and channels\
3 channels -87%: mesial-cheek, mesial-lingual, distal channels\
Mesial root:\
2 channels 1 hole - 40%\
2 channels 2 holes - 60%\
Lateral canals - 45%\
Apical deltoid ramifications - 10%\
Apical opening:\
0-1 mm from apex - 80%\

4 channels -13%\
Distal root: distal-cheek, distal-lingual canals\
1 channel 1 hole - 62%\
2 channels 2 holes - 38%\
Notes: the pulp chamber is in the mesial 2/3 of the crown, has a trapezoidal shape with a wider mesial than the distal part. The bottom of the chamber is convex and located below the neck of the tooth. The mouth of the mesial-buccal canal is located under the top of the corresponding bump. The mouth of the mesial-lingual canal is located between the corresponding tubercle and the central occlusal sulcus. The mouth of the distal canal is projected almost at the intersection of occlusal grooves. The square shape of the pulp chamber indicates the need to search for a second distal channel. Mesial channels often (84%) have a distal curvature. Mesial-lingual canal somewhat larger in diameter and straighter than mesial-buccal.

1 channel 1 hole - 63%\
2 channels 2 holes - 37%\
Notes: all provisions presented in notes to H6 also apply to H7. The mouths of the mesial channels H7 may begin from a common slit-like opening. Both lower molars have a significant inclination to the lingual side with an almost horizontal position of the occlusal surfaces. This sometimes leads to perforation of the tooth from the lingual side.
description.teeth.d1=LOWER CENTRAL CUTTER\
Tooth length in mm: medium - 21, span - 17-25\

1-2 mm from apex -10%\
2 channels - 35%, labial, lingual\
2 channels 1 hole - 27%\
2 channels 2 holes - 8%\
Notes: two channels located in the vestibular oral direction are not uncommon in the lower incisors. A well-sealed single channel on the radiograph masks the one that was not found, with a clear progression of periapical pathology. It should be noted that the lingual canal is located quite close to the lingual surface. Therefore, the access cavity, in order to capture the lingual canal, must descend to the neck of the tooth. If the channel is one, its shape in the apical third is slit-like, if two is rounded.
description.teeth.d2=LOWER SECOND CUTTER\
Tooth length in mm: average -22, span-17-27\
The number and name of the channels\
Channel 1 - 57%\

1-2 mm from apex -10%\
2 channels -43%, labial, lingual\
2 channels 1 hole -14%\
2 channels 2 holes - 29%\
Notes: when developing an access cavity, it is necessary to consider the vestibular-axial at the first, second, third and mesio-axial tilt of the second and third lower teeth. Vestibular-axial slope and pronounced curvature of the vestibular surface can lead to the inclusion of the cutting edge of the lower front teeth into the access cavity. The main difference between HI and H2 is quantitative: a large value of the latter and a large frequency of its second channel.
description.teeth.d3=LOWER FANG\

0-2 mm from apex - 5%\
2 channels - 15/6, labial, lingual\
2 channels 1 hole - 9%\
2 channels 2 holes - 6%\
Notes: the root canal is straight and can give curvatures in the apical part laterally in 20% and / or labial in 7%. The channel in the mouth and middle third is oval and compressed in the mesiodistal direction. The channel axis, as in the lower incisors, passes through the cutting edge, especially in the elderly, which may require its inclusion in the access cavity. Outlines of the access cavity are elongated in the gingival-incisal direction.

2 channels -19%, buccal, lingual\
2 channels 1 hole - 5%\
2 channels 2 holes -14%\
3 channels - 1%\
Notes: the occlusal surface due to a weakly pronounced lingual tuber is sharply inclined to pagan, which can lead to perforation of the buccal surface of the root during a difficult search for a pulp chamber. Well expressed cheek horn. The pulp chamber and the oval-shaped channel are compressed in the mesio-distal direction. The curvature of the apical part is most often in the distal direction (37%). It should be borne in mind that quite often Weine class IV channels are found. According to Vertucci (1978), this option occurs in 24% of cases.
description.teeth.d5=LOWER SECOND PREMOLAR\
Tooth length in mm: medium - 22, span-17-27\
The number and name of the channels\
Channel 1 -97%\
Lateral canals - 48%\
Apical deltoid ramifications - 3%\
Apical opening:\
0-1 mm from apex -65%\
1-2 mm from the apex - 30%\
2 channels - 3%, buccal, lingual\
2 channels 1 hole -1%\
2 channels 2 holes - 2%\
Notes: the pulp chamber and the oval-shaped root canal are compressed in the mesio-distal direction. The channel is straight, but may have a bend in the apical third distal 40% or / and vestibular 10%. An apical opening of 5% may be located 3 mm from the apex. Considering the small distal inclination of the tooth and the frequent distal curvature of the root, an access cavity with mesial displacement should be formed. In the cavity of the tooth expressed wellhead constriction.
description.teeth.d8=Lower third molar\
This tooth is often underdeveloped with numerous and poorly developed tubercles. Usually there can be as many channels as there are bumps. Root canals are relatively larger than other molars, possibly due to the late development of this tooth.\
Despite these shortcomings, it is usually less difficult to seal the roots of the lower than the upper wisdom tooth, since access is usually easier due to the inclination of the tooth to the medial side, and also because they more often follow normal anatomy, resembling a second molar, and less often have deviations from the norm.
description.teeth.u7=Upper second molar.\
Usually this tooth is a small replica of the first molar, however, the roots usually diverge less and more often there is a merger of the two roots. The form with three channels and three apical openings prevails, the average length is 21 mm.\
Root fusion is found in 45-55% of the Caucasian race, and Mongoloids from 65 to 85% of cases. In these cases, usually the mouth of the canals and they themselves are closer to each other or merge.

preparation.molaris.u=Dissection of molars of the upper jaw\
The tooth cavity is opened on the chewing surface using a high-speed machine, after which the canopies of dentin and enamel are removed with a spherical or fissure bur. An autopsy of the tooth cavity is recommended in the direction of a well-traveled root canal, i.e. towards the palate. A reference to a known channel allows you to successfully open the tooth cavity in the future. The opening of the cavity is complete and correct when the probe or endodontic instrument enters the channel when moving along the cavity wall. It is important that the opened cavity of the tooth is clearly visible. Only under this condition are appropriate processing and obstruction of the root canal possible.\
�Errors in the preparation of the tooth cavity:\
a) opening the tooth cavity according to the protrusion (horn of the pulp), which is taken as the mouth of the canals;\
b) weakening of the tooth crown due to excessive dentin removal;\
c) perforation of the bottom of the tooth cavity;\
d) partial opening of the tooth cavity;\
e) perforation of the root canal: with insufficient opening of the carious cavity;\
e) perforation of the root canal when using a tool with a large diameter and an active (sharp) tip.
description.teeth.u8=The third molar of the upper jaw\
The loss of the first and second molars of the upper jaw is often the reason for considering the third molar as a strategic reference. Another indication for endodontic treatment and full recovery is the fully functioning third molars of the lower jaw. Before recommending treatment, it is important to carefully study the morphology of the roots. In many third molars, the roots are adequately formed and, if there is sufficient accessibility, there is no reason not to maintain the functionality of these teeth after endodontic treatment. The root anatomy of the third molar is completely unpredictable, therefore it is advisable to study the morphology of the root canals before promising the success of the treatment. As an alternative to conventional manual processing, the use of endomotors with mounted files and double-sided tips can facilitate accessibility. Pre-bending tools helps guide them through winding channels. For visual and mechanical convenience, access can be made a little wider, but the subsequent full restoration is mandatory. All caries that undergo restoration and calcification of the pulp should be eliminated before treatment. Some third molars have one channel, some two, but most three. The mouths are arranged in the form of a triangle or almost in a straight line. (Burns RC, Buchanan LS. Tooth Morphology and Access Openings. Part One: The Art of Endodontics in Pathway of Pulp, 6th Ed. P. 150).
